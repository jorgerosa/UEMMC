✿ UEMMC - Ultra Easy Minimal Media Converter.
- Developed this only for my own use. But since it could be useful for anyone else too and even it needs a lot of improvements... well... here it is!
- A very handy tool (for me), just gets the job done without too many advanced and confusing settings.
- Compiled for MS Windows OS. (Tested in Win7)
- Portable. (No installation is required)

===========================================================================================================

✿ IMPORTANT:

If you want convert your media file into any other media format (that is not listed there), or even improve your audio / video output settings, there is an included, and very easy to use, console.

Console usage example:

a) Just type in console this command: -codecs

b) Click on SEND button or press the ENTER/RETURN key.

Should output a (long) list of all available codecs. (Other few examples are included)

    - Portable. (No install required)
    - Converts between many many media (audio and video) formats.
    - Powered by ffmpeg!
